This project was designed and developed to give health patient users an application where they will have meals and medicine delivered to their house based on their needs and specifications. They can also access and update their medical records through our virtual Medical Portal which has their information available to view and update. The application is intended for users of all ages but mainly for people who have a tough time getting around from place to place. Older people and people with a medical condition can most benefit from utilizing this application. The app was implemented in Netbeans Java with a MySQL database storing the information from the GUI java interface. 


A Healthcare Portal for Home Care Activities(HCA) who provide services such as a virtual medical portal where they can keep track of their medical history,order meals and have them delivered to home, and provide easier access to necessary medication.
